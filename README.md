 Common Characteristics Seen in Covid-19 Patients

# Project Title
Characteristics of Covid-19 Patients

# Description
Have you ever wondered if certain characteristics can help protect you from Covid-19? By analyzing a diverse range of patient data encompassing factors such as sex, patient type, age, diabetes, obesity, asthma, pneumonia, and classification, this project sought to unravel the nuanced interplay between these variables and the disease outcome. Through sophisticated statistical modeling and data analysis techniques, this project not only provided insights into the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients but also generated predictive models capable of estimating survival probabilities based on individual patient profiles. This endeavor represents a crucial step towards enhancing our understanding of COVID-19 and facilitating more targeted and personalized approaches to patient care and management.
